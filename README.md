 ## About me

 I’m passionate about building new things and constantly learning — that’s what led me to programming. I love how tech challenges us to innovate, grow, and turn ideas into real solutions.

Outside of coding, I enjoy dancing, traveling, and exploring different cultures — activities that fuel my creativity and help me see the world from new perspectives.

I'm currently focused on improving my technical skills and expanding my knowledge, especially in areas like **Artificial Intelligence** and **Automation**, which I believe hold great potential.
